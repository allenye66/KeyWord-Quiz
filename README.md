# KeyWord-Quiz

Description: This website website that allows students to study and improve their memorization. Students can copy paste a body of text into the website, and our algorithm will generate a list of flashcards and a fill-in-the-blank quiz for users to practice and learn. We do this by using natural language processing to extract specific key words from a body of text. These key words mostly consist of nouns, and we take important sentences and our algorithm pairs the noun with its corresponding sentence.
